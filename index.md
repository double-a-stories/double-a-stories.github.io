### Synopsis

Your name is Hollis. You are a small gray rabbit, standing meekly in the foyer of a big, loud suburban house party. Your ears hurt, and in the mere twenty minutes since you've arrived, you've already completely lost sight of your friend who brought you here. Even worse, you're surrounded by huge, drunk anthros who could probably swallow you in seconds. Most alarming of all, one of them is your old high school bully. It's hardly a question of *if* you're gonna get eaten, but rather, by whom.

What will you do?

### Synopsis

You're a rabbit named Juniper Greenall. While you were driving your car from who-knows-where to who-knows-where, a huge snowstorm hit out of the blue. You swerved off the road, got a flat tire, and now your car is stranded underneath a huge pile of accumulating snow. All hope seems lost, until a chance encounter with a mild-mannered polar bear named Zasha leaves you with hope of rescue, plus a room for the night, and maybe even a new friend. Either that, or you'll be left as nothing but a steaming pile of bear shit.
